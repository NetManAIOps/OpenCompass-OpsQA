However, data can only be delivered through the 4G network, not the 5G network.\n\nB: Option3A: In Option3A mode, the 4G network serves as the main network and the 5G network serves as the auxiliary network. However, data can only be delivered through the 4G network, not the 5G network.\n\nC: Option3S: In Option3S mode, both the 4G network and the 5G network can serve as the main network. However, data can only be delivered through one of the networks, not both simultaneously.\n\nD: Option3X: In Option3X mode, the 4G network serves as the main network and the 5G network serves as the auxiliary network. In this mode, data can be delivered simultaneously through both the 4G and 5G air interfaces."

        "answer": "B",
        "solution": "A: Too large: This is incorrect. When the mobile station moves in the direction away from the base station, due to the Doppler effect, the frequency received by the mobile station will actually decrease, not increase.\n\nB: Too small: This is correct. When the mobile station moves in the direction away from the base station, due to the Doppler effect, the frequency received by the mobile station will decrease. This is because the movement of the mobile station leads to an increase in the signal wavelength, and the frequency is the reciprocal of the speed and wavelength, so the frequency will decrease.\n\nC: Unchanged: This is incorrect. The Doppler effect will cause the frequency received by the mobile station to change, whether moving towards the base station or away from it, both will cause changes in the received frequency.\n\nD: All of the above are possible: This is incorrect. In this case, only option B is correct."
